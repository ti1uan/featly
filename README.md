# Featly

Featly is a lightweight, extensible feature development framework designed to streamline the feature engineering process for machine learning projects.

## Vision

Featly aims to simplify feature development and management while maintaining flexibility and extensibility. Our goal is to provide a minimalistic yet powerful framework that helps data scientists and ML engineers focus on creating valuable features rather than dealing with infrastructure complexities.

## Key Features

- **Simple Feature Definition**: Use Pydantic models for type-safe feature definitions with built-in validation
- **Flexible Storage**: Support for various storage backends to accommodate different use cases
- **Version Control**: Built-in feature versioning to track changes and ensure reproducibility
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing support with runtime validation
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to extend and customize for specific needs
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep dependencies minimal to avoid complexity

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Status
This project is currently in early development. We are actively working on:

- [] Core feature definition framework
- [] Basic storage implementations
- [] Feature computation pipeline
- [] Feature validation and testing utilities

## Why Featly?
Why Featly?
While there are several feature stores available (like Feast, Hopsworks), Featly focuses on:

- Simplicity: Minimalistic API design that's easy to understand and use
- Flexibility: Easy to extend and adapt to specific needs
- Developer Experience: Strong typing and validation out of the box
- Learning: Great for understanding feature store concepts and building custom solutions
